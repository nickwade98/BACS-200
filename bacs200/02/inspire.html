            What makes a hero?  A hero is a person who inspires us and we aspire to be. A role model who is selfless, a genuinely good person, and someone who is an exceptional achiever.                             
        </p>
        <p>
            The heroes that I most admire have the following characteristics.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Courage - It's difficult to achieve anything truly heroic unless you're up against daunting odds.</li>
            <li>Selflessness - True leaders always puts others first. Ironically, that kind of selflessness can often be strategic, because focusing on others' needs often winds up helping you achieve your own goals. </li>
            <li>Humility - Nothing makes a heroic leader seem a little less heroic than if he or she seems to want constant credit for his or her actions.</li>
            <li>Pattience - While heroism often requires quick thinking and decisiveness, truly heroic leaders often also display an impressive amount of patience.</li>
            <li>Caring - Separate from selflessness, heroic leaders display a sense of concern and kindness for others.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The aim of professional tennis is to win matches, win grand slams and be number 1. If you can do all three then you can call yourself the best.

Federer has 20 grand slams, has been #1 for 310 weeks, and has won 100 ATP titles.This is more than any other man, apart from ATP titles where Jimmy Connors had 109 after playing until he was 43.They are playing for titles, particularly grand slams, and to be the world #1, this is why ROger Federer is my inspiration and motivates me everyday.
